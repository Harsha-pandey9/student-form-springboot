## Backend Requirements

The frontend is now ready to work with a backend that supports:

1. **Multipart file uploads** (`multipart/form-data`)
2. **Image storage** and serving
3. **Image path storage** in product database
4. **Image serving endpoint** (e.g., `/api/images/{filename}`)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test image upload** with various file types
2. **Test file size validation** with large files
3. **Test image display** in cards and details
4. **Test responsive behavior** on different screen sizes
5. **Test error handling** for network issues

## No Remaining Errors

All identified syntax and functionality errors have been resolved. The application should now run without issues and provide complete image functionality for the product management system.
